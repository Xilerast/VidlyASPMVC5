# Vidly (From Mosh Hamedani's course in Udemy)

This is a video rental web app made in ASP.NET MVC 5, with the assistance of a [course in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/). This implementation is very faithful and similar to the way Mosh Hamedani teaches in this course, with a few exceptions, at least up to the point of the first commit of this repository. Most notable exception is using a session variable on the form to create or edit a customer or a movie, to store the id of the customer/movie, instead of a hidden field, which would make it super vulnerable if there is no authentication.

This can be improved by making it so that the job DataTables do on the client's side is done on the server, since a lot of entries on a database can potentially crash the client or freeze it. Also, it can be made so that view code on the client (Customers/Index.cshtml, the script) is separated from the code that's used to acquire data (AJAX requests). Ideally move that Javascript code to a separate file.
